#### Prelab

Which pins will I use?

I will use pins that output TimerA to output PWM signals to the motors. The pins I will use are P2.0, P2.1, P2.4, and P2.5. To achieve PWM, I will use a different output mode with the TimerA control. I can use TimerA output modes Set/Reset, Toggle/Reset, Toggle/Set, or Toggle/Reset.
